                  AgroConnect is a platform that aims to bridge the gap between
                  farmers and consumers by eliminating exploitation and hoarding
                  that brings about food scarcity and insecurity. We intend to
                  
                  use this platform to promote and provide availability and
                  accessibility if food and cash crops, prevention of food
                  wastage and other difficulties faced by farmers and consumers.
