# AgroConnect

AgroConnect is a platform that aims to bridge the gap between farmers and consumers by eliminating exploitation and hoarding that brings about food price inflation, scarcity and insecurity. We intend to use this platform to promote and provide availability and accessibility of food and cash crops, prevention of food wastage and other difficulties faced by farmers and consumers.
